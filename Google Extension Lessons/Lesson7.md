# Lesson 7 — What is a service worker? (no code yet)

A <b>service worker</b> is:

- Not always running

- Not a page

- Not a script you “call”

- An event listener machine

It exists to respond to:

- Extension icon clicks

- Messages

- Alarms

- Tab events

Then it shuts down.

### Why Chrome forced this (MV3)

Old extensions abused background pages.

Service workers:

- Save memory

- Enforce good design

- Force event-driven thinking

Painful at first. Better long-term.
